Application Views
=================

A set of views is provided to let users handle application instances without accessing Django Admin
Site. Application views are listed at the url `applications/` and you can register a new one at the
url `applications/register`. You can override default templates located in
`templates/oauth2_provider` folder and provide a custom layout. Every view provides access only to
data belonging to the logged in user who performs the request.
